# MEAN Bootstrapper (pre-alpha af)
love web development, but hate starting from the bottom like Drake? I've made my work of getting started with the MEAN stack available to help get an application scaffolded.

# Coming Up

- grunt/bower buildscripts to make this what I really want it to be
- comments in source files to make them easier to read
- who knows??????
